RandomFields
====
Python package to generate random fields in 2D or 3D on unstructured grids.


User guide
==========

Background information
......................
The random fields are generated using `gstools <https://geostat-framework.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.

Currently, the following covariance models are available:

* Gaussian
* Exponential
* Matern
* Linear (not for conditioned random fields)

Additional functoinalities are used to generate conditioned random fields.
